## Hi there, whats up? 👋

### My name is Murillo Maciel, I'm 25 years old, I'm married and father of dogs.

Although I study algorithm and software development since I was 17 years old, I started to study Android development 5 years ago and flutter 2 years ago. 
I had studied and worked with firmware using C and assembly before discover Mobile development. Now I'm passionate for mobile and can't see me doing anything else.

- 🏢 I'm currently working for iFood as an Android Software Engineer.
- 🔭 I’m also currently working on an open source app called MuTalk that compiles all that I think is the best for Android Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Compose and reading Clean Architecture and Clean Code.
- 💬 Ask me about firmware and stuff, that I still think is interesting.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've already been a badminton professional player. I was training to participate in Rio 2016. I also played the Guitar and the Violin when I was a teenager.
