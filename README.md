## Hi there, whats up? 👋

### My name is Murillo Maciel, I'm 26 years old, I'm married and father of dogs.

Although I have been studying algorithms and software development since I was 17 years old, I started to study Android development 5 years ago and flutter 2 years ago. 
I had studied and worked with firmware using C and assembly before I discovered Mobile development. Now I'm passionate for mobile and can't see me doing anything else.

- 🏢 I'm currently working at iFood as Senior Android Software Engineer.
- 🔭 I’m also currently working on an open source app called MuTalk that compiles all that I think is the best for Android Development (this project is stopped for some time, because of next topic).
- 🌱 I'm focusing my attention on soft skills right now. My career planning to become a Staff Android Engineer are involving some leadership and mentoring growth.
- 🌱 I’m adapting myself and learning Jetpack Compose, and I'm also reading Clean Architecture and Clean Code.
- 🌍 Languages: Portuguese(Native) and English(Advanced).
- 💬 Ask me about firmware and stuff, because I still think is interesting (Even nowadays, when I can't do malloc anymore kkk).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've already been a badminton professional player. I was training to participate in Rio 2016 olympics. I also played the Guitar and the Violin when I was a teenager.
