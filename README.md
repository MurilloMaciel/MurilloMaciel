## Hi there, whats up? 👋

### My name is Murillo Maciel, I'm 28 years old, I'm married and father of dogs.

Although I have been studying algorithms and software development since I was 17 years old, I started to study Android development 6 years ago and flutter 2 years ago. 
I had studied and worked with firmware using C and assembly before I discovered Mobile development. Now I'm passionate for mobile and can't see me doing anything else.

- 🏢 I'm a Senior Android Software Engineer at iFood, the biggest food delivery company in Brazil.
- 🔭 I have some side projects, but I am currently working on MuInvest, focused on your investment wallet. With this project I intent to focus on gradle and CICD.
- 🌱 The skill I am focusing on learning now is gradle and CICD.
- 🌍 Languages: Portuguese(Native) and English(Advanced).
- 💬 Ask me about firmware and stuff, because I still think is interesting (Although it is now just a nostalgic memory).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've already been a badminton professional player. I was training to participate in Rio 2016 olympics. I also played the Guitar and the Violin when I was a teenager.
